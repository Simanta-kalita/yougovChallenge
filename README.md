# Full-stack developer challenge

## Marking criteria (most important first)

1. Function - Does it work as intended and solve the problem?
2. Ease of making changes - Could another team member easily understand it and make changes?
3. Typescript code quality score - This is an automated process
4. Ease of deployment to existing AWS account - Does it conflict with other stacks?
5. Quality of commit messages - Are they consistent and could another team member understand what each change does?
